# Nautilus Lite
A simple and strip down version of Nautilus Mobile SDK for Xamarin Forms.
Samples here are written using whatever the Xamarin Forms world has. 

## Todo Sample App
To get started with this sample, I had some help from a sample that was built by [Kym Phillpotts](https://kymphillpotts.com/author/kphillpotts/), an expert in crafting awesome Xamarin Forms UI. The sample app he crafted can be found here [Xamarin.Forms UI Challenges - Art Auction](https://kymphillpotts.com/xamarin-forms-ui-challenge-artauction.html)
